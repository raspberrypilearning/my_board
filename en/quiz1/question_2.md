legend: Question 2 of 3

If you had this HTML code:

```html
<div class="grid_box"> </div>
```

And this CSS:

```css
.grid_box{
  background-color: white;
  border: 1px solid red;
  color: red;
}
```

Which of these changes would make the `div` visible to users?
--- choices ---

- (x) ```html
<div class="grid_box"> Hi everyone! </div>
```

  --- feedback ---
Correct! By putting some content into the `div`, it will grow to be large enough to hold that content.

- ( ) ```css
.grid_box{
  background-color: green;
  border: 1px solid red;
  color: red;
}
```

The `div` doesn't just look invisble. It has no size (width, or height), so it doesn't take up any space on the page at all.
